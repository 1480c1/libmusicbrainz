Installation of the MusicBrainz client library
==============================================

  The instructions in this file should help you to build and install the
  MusicBrainz client library from source on your system.

Dependencies
============

  Before you start, make sure you have installed following libraries:

  * Neon -- HTTP client library
    http://www.webdav.org/neon/
    
  * (optional) CppUnit -- C++ unit testing framework
    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cppunit-wiki
    Only required to compile and run the test suite.
    
Building on *nix
================

  Once you have installed all dependencies, you can compile the
  library:
    
    $ ./configure
    $ make
  
  To build and run the test suite use:
  
    $ make check
    
  And to install the built library run (as root):
  
    $ make install
   
Building on Windows
===================

  To build libmusicbrainz on Windows you can use Cygwin/MSYS and follow the
  instructions from the previous sections. Alternativelly you can use the 
  SCons <http://www.scons.org/> build scripts and build the library by running:
  
    $ scons
    
Subversion Snapshots
====================

  If you want to build a snapshot of the source from Subversion at
  http://svn.musicbrainz.org/libmusicbrainz/trunk/ on a *nix system, you will
  need to generate the build scripts first. You can do this be installing
  autoconf, automake and libtool and running:
  
    $ ./autogen.sh

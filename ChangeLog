	* Tagged everything, we're going 2.0 now
	

1999-08-16  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* cdi_beos.cpp:
	  Stephen van Egmond forwarded a change that is supposed 
	  to make the BeOS client recognize the device 
	  specified on the commmand line. Author unknown.

	  Jeez, the first update in six weeks! Shame on me.
	

1999-07-01  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* Bumped version to 1.2.1
	
	* cdi_freebsd.cpp, cdi_netbsd.cpp, cdi_openbsd.cpp:
	  Threw away unused variables.
	
	* cdindex.cpp:
	  Added times to debug track listing
	

1999-06-30  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* cdi_solaris.cpp, cdi_solaris.h:
	  I put in some corrections mostly due to Winston Chang
	  so I think it should work now out of the box
	

1999-06-29  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* configure.in:
	  After confirmation, switch version string 
	  from 1.2.0pre to 1.2.0
	

1999-06-28  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* configure.in:
	  set the the client version to 1.2.0pre
	
	
1999-06-27  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* cdi_<os>.cpp, cdi_<os>.h:
	  Added the -d option proposed by Stephen van Egmond.

	* cdi_beos.cpp, cdi_beos.h:
	  Added the files sent by Stephen van Egmond.
	
	* Have to ask him about BeOS assumptions on integer sizes.
	  The assumptions in the program so far seem to be:
    	      sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long)
	      sizeof(int) = 4
	  Remember: Solaris >= 2.6 is 64 bit, Irix 6 too!
	
	
1999-06-13  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* cdi_linux.cpp, cdi_linux.h:
	  a bit of code polishing

	* cdi_solaris.cpp, cdi_solaris.h:
	  I was soo stupid (see comments) .. but I hope it has a good chance
	  to built and run now!

	* qa/solaris-emu:
	  added an emulation for Solaris

	* had a look at the Darwin (Rhapsody?) sources from Apple Computer Inc,
	  because it has been welcomed by the BSD camp and I want to make the
	  Mac crowd happy, but I can't see any similarities regarding CDDA 
	  control yet .. 
	  what a strange, incomplete brew of NeXT, Mac and BSD stuff!

	
1999-06-10  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* introduced support for NetBSD and OpenBSD
	
	* Updated the MSVC++ project files to MSVC++ 6.0
	

1999-06-10  Robert Kaye  <rob@goodnoise.com>

	* updated AUTHORS

	
1999-06-08  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* updated configure etc with recent versions

	* updated the INSTALL doc
	

1999-06-04  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* added Ben's description to INSTALL (thanks for the IRIX binary too!)

	* started OS/2 and Solaris support (both are not supposed
	  to build or work right now)

	  Bah, the internal layout sucks! - after 1.1.0 release
	  operation Augeas 
	
	      http://despina.advanced.org/23057/stables7.html
	
	  has to start!
	
        * improved project file for Win32/MSVC++
	
        * changed sha_func.c to supress some conversion warnings
	
	* changed cdindex.h to use '_WIN32' for recognizing the Win32
	  platform and within this '__CYGWIN__' to differentiate
	  between usual Windows environment based compilers and the UNIX
	  like Cygwin environment
	

1999-06-03  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* Ben Wong tested the IRIX version and fixed some errors,
	  he also added some comments to the Linux version

	* updated the MSVC++ project files (which I have to have
	  a look again when I understand the IDE better)
	  This make the client compile and run again under Win32!
	

1999-05-21  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* added a build emulation for Win32/MS VC++

	* updated cdi_win32.cpp and cdi_win32.h to work again
	

1999-05-20  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* updated the server URL for Irix
	
	* updated the address of the mailing list to cdindex@cdindex.org
	
	* updated the Linux status in INSTALL
	
	* fixed some problems with CVS that caused configuration errors
	  and unnecessary autoheader/-conf/-make runs


1999-05-14  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* added a hint about using GNU make


1999-05-07  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* modified the docs a bit

	
1999-05-06  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* told cvsclean target to nuke files ending with .exe

	
1999-05-05  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* adapted the win32/MS VC++ code to run under Cygwin, due to
	  incompleteness of the Cygwin headers this blew up cdi_cygwin.h
	  a bit
	  Welcome on board, Cygwin!
	

1999-05-04  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* introduced a 'qa' (quality assurance) subdirectory to help release
	  engineering by use of partially emulated clients - this should 
	  catch easy errors like stupid typos and certain linkage failures - 
	  first candidate: the Irix client

	
1999-05-03  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>
	
	* took a lesson from the Linux failure, thus tested compilation of 
	  the Irix client with a bogus header/lib - it compiles and spawns a 
	  browser. 

	* Cygwin client should compile and run now (and exit with a message
	  that it can't read the TOC :)
	
	* changed a typo in cdi_linux.cpp that prevented compilation
	  under Linux

	* updated the home URL to www.cdindex.org - in both cases thanks
	  to Nick Lamb <njl98r@ecs.soton.ac.uk> for pointing this out

	* told cvsclean target to nuke the tarball if present

	* the Irix target enforces more modifications to the specific
	  and general code (it is more odd than Linux ;-)

	* solved how to hold back the symbolic links from the tarball
	

1999-05-02  Marc van Woerkom  <van.woerkom@netcologne.de>

	* several changes to the platform specific cdi_<osname>.cpp and 
	  cdi_<osname>.h files

	* introduced a BUGS file

	* updated README file

	* added information to INSTALL file

        * added the new files to Makefile.am
	
	* hope to have updated all autoconf stuff to version 2.13 plus all
	  automake and aclocal stuff to 1.4

	* added cdi_irix.cc and cdi_irix.h and filled them according to the 
	  changes sent by Ben Wong <cdindex@wongs.net> - not finished yet

	* added Irix target to configure.in

	* sorted AUTHORS file by first name, reformatted it to include the 
	  authors e-mail addresses

	* added cygwin target to configure.in

	* added a cvsclean target to Makefile.am, to help me not to check
	  in bogus files (and worse: directories) into CVS

	* added dummy cdi_cygwin.cc and cdi_cygwin.h to allow configuration
	  and compilation under Win32 Cygwin environment

	* switched to the change log format supported by mighty Emacs,
	  moved the old ChangeLog file to NEWS

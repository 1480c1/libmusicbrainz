README for Musicbrainz Client Library Build (libmusicbrainz)
Using Microsoft Development Studio 7

If you wish to use IBM's ICU Libraries with libmusicbrainz:

Add only the icudata and icuuc libraries to your project.
You can add them by going to Project->musicbrainz Properties, 
and then Linker->Input.  Add them into the Additional Dependencies box.

You must then define the USE_ICU preprocessor definition.
You can add this by going to C/C++ -> Preprocessor, and adding USE_ICU
at the end of the list.
